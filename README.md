## Util Module Example

### General information:

In the example, we first require in the util module. Next, we declare two variables: today stores todayâ€™s date as an instance of the Date object, and earthDay stores the date of Earth Day as a string. We then log the results of type checking each variable using util.types.isDate(). The types.isDate() method checks for Date objects and returns a boolean value, giving us:
- true
- false

Since today is a Date object, it returns true, and since earthDay is a string, it returns false.

### Tools used:
